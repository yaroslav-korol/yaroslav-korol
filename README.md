# Hi, I'm Yaroslav üëã

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a strong interest in scalable systems, APIs, and clean code. I enjoy working across the stack when needed, and I'm currently deepening my understanding of software design, data structures, and system architecture.

üñ§ In love with C.


## üíª What I'm Working On

- **Backend & System Design:** Python, FastAPI, async processing, microservices
- **Real-world experience:** Dockerized data workers, API-based data pipelines, geospatial optimization, cloud infrastructure
- **Core Engineering Skills:** Applying everything I learn ‚Äî from SOLID principles and design patterns to system-level thinking


## üìö Projects & Practice

- [**youtube-clone-fullstack**](https://github.com/yaroslav-korol/youtube-clone-fullstack)  
  A full-stack video-sharing platform inspired by YouTube. Built with TypeScript, Next.js, Express, Firebase, Docker, FFmpeg, and GCP. Features video upload, transcoding via Pub/Sub, playback, and secure auth.  
  _Backend microservices, event-driven architecture, async pipelines._  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [See README for details](https://github.com/yaroslav-korol/youtube-clone-fullstack)
  
- [**swe-foundations-python**](https://github.com/yaroslav-korol/swe-foundations-python)  
  My personal coding archive ‚Äî implementations of algorithms, OOP, design patterns, SOLID, and more.
  
- **Production worker (private repo):**  
  A real-world Celery-based worker handling blockchain transactions and service integrations. Available on request.

- [**youtube-clone-frontend**](https://github.com/yaroslav-korol/youtube-clone-frontend)  
  Responsive frontend project built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS ‚Äî [Live demo](https://yaroslav-korol.github.io/youtube-clone-frontend)


## üöÄ Ongoing Learning

I'm also reinforcing my computer science foundations by solving algorithm problems and studying system design:

- Practicing on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/yaroslav_v_korol/) ‚Äî currently solving problems following the NeetCode roadmap  
- Practicing async patterns, message queues, and cloud-native architecture in real projects
- Exploring system design concepts to improve architectural thinking
