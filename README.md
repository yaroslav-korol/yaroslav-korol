# Hi, I'm Yaroslav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a strong interest in scalable systems, APIs, and clean code. I enjoy working across the stack when needed, and I'm currently deepening my understanding of software design, data structures, and system architecture.

ðŸ–¤ In love with C.

## ðŸ’» What I'm Working On

- **Backend & System Design:** Python, FastAPI, async processing, microservices
- **Real-world experience:** Blockchain-integrated data workers, API-based data pipelines, production codebases
- **Core Engineering Skills:** Implementing everything I learn â€” from SOLID principles and design patterns to algorithmic thinking

## ðŸ“š Projects & Practice

- [**swe-foundations-python**](https://github.com/yaroslav-korol/swe-foundations-python)  
  My personal coding archive â€” implementations of algorithms, OOP, design patterns, SOLID, and more.
  
- **Production worker (private repo):**  
  A real-world Celery-based worker handling blockchain transactions and service integrations. Available on request.

- [**youtube-clone-frontend**](https://github.com/yaroslav-korol/youtube-clone-frontend)  
  Responsive frontend project built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS â€” [Live demo](https://yaroslav-korol.github.io/youtube-clone-frontend)

## ðŸš€ Ongoing Learning

I'm also reinforcing my computer science foundations by solving algorithm problems and studying system design:

- Practicing on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/yaroslav_v_korol/) â€” currently solving problems following the NeetCode roadmap  
- Studying system design concepts to improve architectural thinking
